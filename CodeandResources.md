## Datasets

### Match N Mingle dataset

<img style="float: left;" src="../img/modalities.svg" width="500"/>

The MatchNMingle (MnM) is a novel multi-sensor resource for the analysis of social interactions and group dynamics in-the-wild during free-standing conversations and speed dates, available openly for research purposes. It was recorded in-the-wild during 3 speed date events, each followed by a mingle (cocktail party). All events took place in a public bar with a total of 92 participants which were not acquaintance before the event.

It consists of 2 hours of data from wearable acceleration, binary proximity, video, audio, personality surveys, frontal pictures and speed-date responses. Participantsâ€™ positions and group formations were manually annotated; as were social actions (walking, stepping, drinking, speaking, hand gesture, head gesture, laugh) for 30 minutes at 20fps making it the first dataset to incorporate the annotation of such cues in this context
