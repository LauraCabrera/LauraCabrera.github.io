I am an assistant professor at the [Costa Rican Institute of Technology](https://tec.ac.cr/en) or TEC (Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica), working in the Electronics Engineering department.

Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/)(The Netherlands) where I was involved in the ALARM Project from [e\MTIC](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/eindhoven-medtech-innovation-center/). This project was a collaboration with the [Maxima Medical Center](https://www.mmc.nl/) and [Philips research](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/locations/eindhoven.html). I also worked as a post-doctoral researcher in the [Socially Perceptive Computing Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/socially-perceptive-computing-lab/) in TU Delft (The Netherlands), where I am currently a guest researcher.

## Research

My research focuses on the use of machine learning and non-invasive technologies, such as wearable and embedded devices, video cameras or physiological sensors; to understand human social behavior, monitor health, and overall improve people's quality of life. I love to work in the interdisciplinary world that fuses hardware with software, and is motivated by social or natural sciences (e.g. medicine or psychology).

## Education

I received my PhD (2018) in Computer Science from the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) (The Netherlands) with the thesis entitled ***Automatic analysis of human social behavior in-the-wild using multimodal streams*** (can be found [here](https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai:tudelft.nl:uuid%3A811ba745-18e1-4dca-8321-249ba000a142)). Before that I received a Master in Science in Electronics Engineering with emphasis in Embedded Systems (2014) and a *Licenciatura* in Electronics Engineering (2012), both from the [TEC](https://tec.ac.cr/en) (Costa Rica).
