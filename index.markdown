I am an assistant professor at the [Costa Rican Institute of Technology](https://tec.ac.cr/en) or TEC (Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica), working in the Electronics Engineering department.
My research focus on the use of machine learning and non-invasive technologies (e.g. wearable and embedded devices, cameras, physiological sensors) to understand human behavior, monitor health, and improve people's quality of life.

<!---I received my PhD. in Computer Science from the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) (The Netherlands) and a Master in Electronical Engineering with emphasis in Embedded Systems from the TEC (Costa Rica).

Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/)(The Netherlands) where I was involved in the ALARM Project from [e\MTIC](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/eindhoven-medtech-innovation-center/). This project was a collaboration with the [Maxima Medical Center](https://www.mmc.nl/) and [Philips research](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/locations/eindhoven.html). I also worked as a post-doctoral researcher in the [Socially Perceptive Computing Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/socially-perceptive-computing-lab/) in TU Delft (The Netherlands), where I am currently a guest researcher. 

I am currently the chair of the [ACM SIGCHI local chapter in Costa Rica](http://sigchicostarica.acm.org/). Please do not hesitate to contact me if want to be involved with the chapter, or if you are a current member and have an specific initiative that as a chapter we could help with.
