Our paper entitled *Estimation of heart frequency directly from ECG spectrogram in Neonate Intensive Care Units* has been accepted for oral presentation at the 42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC'20). 

The conference would sadly possibily be in a vritual modality due to the current situation, but the ALARM team are excited nonetheless.
