As the dust settles and [ICMI 2024](https://icmi.acm.org/2024/) in Costa Rica comes to a close, I cannot thank our amazing team enough Hayley Hung Catharine Oertel Mohammad Soleymani Yuen C. Law Wan Yoselyn Walsh Zuniga, Ph.D. Pablo Alvarado Moya, student volunteers and all people who helped us.  And thank you to the Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica for all the support.


The conference was a success! We had amazing presentations and conversations. Our wonderful community embraced the diversity of perspectives in research from all corners of the world, and how we can turn these differences into an opportunity for collective growth rather than see them as limitations.

See you in Canberra in 2025! Pura vida!
