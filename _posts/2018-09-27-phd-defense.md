Today, I officially defended my PhD! 

My thesis entitled ***Automatic analysis of human social behavior in-the-wild using multimodal streams*** can be found [here](https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai:tudelft.nl:uuid%3A811ba745-18e1-4dca-8321-249ba000a142). I have to thank my supervisor Hayley Hung and my promotor Marcel Reinders for their support and the opportunity.
